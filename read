Create an application that can be deployed into  app engine, Cloud run or Cloud Functions and store your project files into a Github repository
Implement required services so once you perform a push to the repository with a code change, a new image is built and stored into artifact registry.
Use the same build process to then deploy your code to a serverless service.
Due to security reasons, you require that all builds are performed in private vms with no access to the internet. Implement a solution to meet this requirement.
